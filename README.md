EasyAES, a friendly Java interface for AES-GCM-SIV

EasyAES is a friendly Java interface for AES-GCM-SIV. The project is based on Mr. Codahale's implementation of [Codahale's AES-GCM-SIV](https://github.com/codahale/aes-gcm-siv)
For more information, please download EasyAES API Reference Book.pdf.

Disclaimer:
This project is based on Mr. Codahale's AES-GCM-SIV project; I only perform some slight fixes for JRE 10 and provide an interface with easy access. The benchmark program, which originally included in the project has been removed because of some incompatibility issues with JRE 10. For more information, please check on [Codahale's AES-GCM-SIV](https://github.com/codahale/aes-gcm-siv) and [IETF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-gcmsiv-08)

Running Environment:
